Tampermonkey userscript to remove t.co outbound tracking links from tweets

## Features

1) URLS within tweets linking to an external website will be set to the actual link, not Twitter's t.co outbound trackers.
This also applies to all links in sight within your timeline. 
2) Also, you get an option in the left sidebar to run the script at will, for example when you've scrolled down further and fresh tweets were loaded, which have not yet been processed by this script.

## Installation
To install, copy this https://possuminabox.github.io/pr0gramm-Tagscore/pr0gramm-tagscore.user.js into your browser's address bar or simply click on it, your userscript plugin should launch and install automatically.

**Heads Up**: This of course needs Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey
